      blob: "This website  <a class='text-regal-blue-300 underline' href='https://github.com/nduartech/monorepo-v1' target='_blank'>started off</a> as an exploration of micro-frontends and SPAs, using Astro and SolidJS. The inspiration for that initial version came from this <a class='text-regal-blue-300 underline' href='https://medium.com/@sergio.a.soria/setting-up-micro-frontends-with-astro-and-ecma-script-modules-137340d2c520' target='_blank'>excellent Medium post by Sergio A. Arevalo Soria.</a> I later decided to rewrite the entire site in the single-spa framework, the code for which can be found <a class='text-regal-blue-300 underline' href='https://github.com/nduartech/nduartech.github.io/tree/single-spa' target='_blank'>here on Github</a>. As part of this rewrite, I wrote <a class='text-regal-blue-300 underline' href='https://github.com/nduartech/single-spa-solid' target='_blank'>a utility to allow the use of single-spa with SolidJS microfrontends</a>. With that said, however, ultimately I chose <a class='text-regal-blue-300 underline' href='https://github.com/nduartech/nduartech.github.io/tree/master' target='_blank'>to return to Astro</a>, this time using the Qwik + Astro integration, as I found both the DX and results just a tad better than with single-spa. In the latest version, the landing page is a component written in Svelte, both sub-sites are SolidJS micro-frontends, while the dark/light theming functionality is written in Qwik. This demonstrates some of the flexibility front-end developers have when using a modern stack.",

      blob: "Among the array of challenges faced, the creation of a file import service emerged as notably difficult. This service required efficient processing of large data files containing complex payment information in diverse formats inherited from the legacy system. To tackle this challenge, I carefully designed a solution using the Spring Integration framework alongside the YAVI validation framework. This strategy entailed detailed, asynchronous validation of each line in the file, covering both formatting and business logic, before aggregating the outcomes. Importantly, this service plays a crucial role in facilitating the transition of clients from the old platform to TS Online Banking."

      blob: "If not for imports, implementing migration would have been easily my most troublesome task. Initially, our process relied on the periodic provision of client data extracts by the legacy system management and development team, and subsequent manual import of said files into our Mongo database. With that in mind, we leveraged the pre-existing imports service for our initial implementation. However, the focus subsequently shifted to autonomously obtaining these extracts, requiring direct connections to the legacy MSSQL and DB2 databases. This transition at first involved the creation and manipulation of intermediary files before the actual ingestion to our Mongo instance, an evidently inefficient approach. Therefore, I undertook a redevelopment initiative to bypass file generation entirely. Despite encountering obstacles, we successfully accomplished the task, once again easing client transition from the legacy platform to TS Online Banking."
